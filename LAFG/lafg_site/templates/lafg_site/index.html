            <h3 class="">What do we do?</h3>
            <p>US Focus Groups primarily services law firms that are interested in hearing feedback about their cases before they go to trial. This feedback is often elicited from participants with the use of focus groups. For the typical focus group, a moderator will present the facts and evidence of a case as it will be presented in trial and prompt discussion from the group regarding their opinions on the case. </p>
